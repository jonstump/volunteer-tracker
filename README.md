```

## To dos:
* Fix bug for adding Volunteers
* Add Update for Volunteers
* Pass final integration test
* Add update method for Volunteer class
* run bash command to add sql file to project
  - pg_dump volunteer_tracker > database_backup.sql

## Bugs:
* Breaks on adding a Volunteer
  - Possible fix is a route using Projects
  - Other possible fix is to make the project id on the volunteer nil when adding then allowing for them to be updated on the project page.
